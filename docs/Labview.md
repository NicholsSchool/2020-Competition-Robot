# Alternative Progamming Languages: Labview

As new students join the team, some may choose to change the langauge we use to program our robots. Currently, FRC has support for C++, Java, and Labview, and the community is building support for Python. We think it is likely that the team will eventually switch to python programming when the enough resources become available to help in that project. A seperate article in this documentation will go over the current (2020) resources and capabilities of programming FRC robots in python. This article will go over all the info our programming team currently knows about Labview.
